# BSMP24 Advanced Coding Program - Instructor Guide  
   
Welcome to the BSMP24 Advanced Coding Program! This guide is designed to help you navigate through the course, prepare lessons, and support your students effectively.  
   
## Course Overview  
The BSMP24 Advanced Coding Program is part of the 2024 BAM Summer Mentorship Program (BSMP) by Microsoft. The program focuses on advanced Python programming, web app development, and AI tools integration.   
  
### Key Components  
- **GitHub Copilot**: For code suggestions and completions.  
- **VSCode**: As the primary code editor.  
- **Python**: Core programming language.  
- **AI and ChatGPT**: For building intelligent applications.  
   
### Learning Outcomes  
- Interactive learning of Python programming and web development.  
- Practical experience with AI tools and their integration.  
- Development and presentation of end-to-end coding projects.  
   
## Lesson Plan  
Below is the structured lesson plan for the course:  
   
1. **Intro to GitHub/Copilot, VSCode, and Python**  
2. **Python and Intro to Streamlit Web App**  
3. **Integrating to Streamlit and ChatGPT for Chat App**  
4. **Python Fundamentals & GitHub Copilot**  
5. **Python Conditionals and Loops**  
6. **Advanced ChatGPT / Generative AI Tools**  
7. **Computer Vision**  
8. **Final Project Preparation and Updates**  
   - Developing an end-to-end application using learned skills.  
   - Applying Python and AI tools for project implementation.  
   - Presentation and review of final projects.  
9. **Student Video Coding Project Presentation**  
   
## Preparing for Class  
### Pre-Class Preparation  
1. **Access to Materials**: Ensure all students have access to the course deck. If access is not available, provide assistance.  
2. **Course Overview**: Familiarize yourself with the course deck, including past student projects and course objectives, for a comprehensive understanding of the course direction.  
3. **Technical Setup**: Ensure students have GitHub accounts and are familiar with GitHub classrooms. Spend initial class time setting up.  
4. **Prepare the Coding Lesson**: Complete the homework assignments and reading materials.  
5. **Join the Meeting**: Ensure you have video on and audio off.  
   
### Coding Office Hours  
- **Optional Attendance**: Mondays and Fridays.  
   
## During Class  
### Lesson Plan Flow  
1. Start with an overview of the homework assignment.  
2. Introduce the lesson concept.  
3. Conduct activity/reflection.  
4. Introduce the next homework assignment.  
   
### Breakout Sessions  
- **Purpose**: Facilitate local sessions for students to present thoughts on activities, reflection, and share homework solutions.  
- **Structure**: After breakout sessions, rejoin the main call to continue with the class.  
- **BAM Mentors**: Responsible for creating the breakout rooms.  
   
## Final Student Video Coding Project  
The final student video coding project is a key component of the BSMP24 Advanced Coding Program. Here are the key points:  
   
### Project Criteria  
- Must be a video presentation.  
- At least 5 minutes long.  
- Demonstrate understanding of coding and Python.  
- Must be creative and original.  
   
### Key Points from Instructor Meeting  
1. **Distinct from Hackathon**: The student video project presentation is distinctly different from the hackathon projects.  
2. **Presentation Schedule**: The last Tuesday of each chapter is dedicated to the student video project presentation. No planned activities on the following Thursday due to the hackathon day.  
3. **Chapter-Level Facilitation**: Each chapter is encouraged to facilitate the coding video projects on the last Tuesday, utilizing class time for this purpose.  
   
### Submission  
- Students must submit their video by the last Tuesday of the BSMP chapter before class.
